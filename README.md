# 🔐 Unbalanced  Secure Computation Protocol using Homomorphic Encryption

## ✨ Overview 

This project implements an **Unbalanced Two-party Secure Computation Protocol** based on **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)**, enabling privacy-preserving arithmetic operations over encrypted data. The protocol adopts a client–server architecture in which:

- **The Client** encrypts input data and selects an operation.

- **The Server** performs the desired operation  without decrypting the data.

- The encrypted result is sent back to the client.

Designed with **TenSEAL**, the protocol supports multiple HE schemes **(BFV, Paillier, CKKS)** for **integer and floating-point** operations, featuring a user-friendly **Tkinter GUI**.

## 🚀 Usage

- 1. Start the Server

     
         python3 server.py
        
    Server runs on 127.0.0.1:12345 by default

- 2. Launch the Client GUI

         python3 client.py
         
- 3. Perform Operations:

     - Enter the  required data

     - Select the encryption scheme

     - Select the arithmatic operation (buttons auto-adjust based on scheme)

     - The final result is decrypted and it is shown in the output box of the GUI

## Note:
For the **BFV** scheme in our construction, the value of plain modulus is **536903681** (i.e., the value of t), the value of poly modulus degree is **8192** which controls the size of the polynomials used in the encryption and determines the number of coefficients in the polynomial modulus. The coefficient modulus bit sizes are **[60,40,40,60]** which refers to the bit sizes of the moduli for the first, second, and third slots of the polynomial. These moduli, in turn, determine the overall ciphertext modulus **q**.  The overall ciphertext modulus is the product of these primes, providing the modulus under which the coefficients of the polynomial will be reduced during homomorphic operations.  In **TenSEAL**, the ciphertext modulus is not explicitly given as a single value, but it is derived from the coefficient modulus (a collection of primes) set in the encryption parameters. The ciphertext modulus influences the security and performance of the encryption but is typically handled automatically through the coefficient modulus bit sizes and poly modulus degree settings. For the **CKKS**, the value of poly modulus degree is **8192**  and the coefficient modulus bit sizes are **[60,40,40,60]**.
